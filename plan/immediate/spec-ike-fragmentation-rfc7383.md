## Task

Ze implements no RFC 7383 (IKEv2 Message Fragmentation). The only trace of it
is the `NotifyFragmentationSupported` constant in
`internal/component/ike/wire/payload_notify.go`, which is never sent and never
negotiated, so no peer learns that Ze could fragment and Ze never learns that
the peer can.

The symptom an operator meets: an IKE_AUTH carrying certificates is several
kilobytes, and IP fragments it. A path that drops IP fragments (a NAT box, a
firewall, a broken PMTU path) drops the IKE_AUTH, the exchange retransmits into
the same drop, and the tunnel never establishes. strongSwan (the lab peer) and libreswan both
implement RFC 7383, fragment at the IKE layer, and establish over the same
path. That is a bug on the first release, hence `plan/immediate/`.

The open ledger row is `rfc/short/rfc7296.md` RFC7296-2.1-1 ("Messages too
large for path MTU should use IKEv2 fragmentation (RFC 7383)", SHOULD), which
stays open until this spec lands. `rfc/full/rfc7383.txt` was fetched on
2026-09-16; no `rfc/short/rfc7383.md` exists yet, and `/ze-rfc` writes it when
this spec enters `design`.

Two constraints inherited from `plan/spec-ike-padded-path-probe.md`:

| Constraint | Source |
|------------|--------|
| A path-MTU probe is never IKE-fragmented. RFC 7383 Section 2.5.2 makes PMTU discovery OPTIONAL and searches fragmentation thresholds downward, so a fragmented probe would measure the threshold rather than the path. The fragmentation code MUST recognize the probe exchange and leave it whole, whatever the negotiated threshold | `plan/spec-ike-padded-path-probe.md`, AC-6 and R-8 |
| The per-datagram DF send and the error-queue drain that spec adds to `internal/component/ike/transport` are what this spec's own PMTU search reuses (RFC 7383 Section 2.5.2: "It is the initiator of the exchange who performs PMTU discovery"). This spec adds no second DF mechanism and no second error-queue reader | `plan/spec-ike-padded-path-probe.md`, phase 2 |

Owner decision, 2026-09-16: opened as a skeleton, built after
`plan/spec-ike-padded-path-probe.md`. Everything below the Task section is a
template placeholder until this spec enters `design`.

## Required Reading

### Architecture Docs
- [ ] `docs/architecture/<doc>.md` - [why relevant]
  → Decision: [specific architectural decision that constrains this spec]
  → Constraint: [specific rule from the doc that applies here]

### RFC Summaries (Scope: protocol)
- [ ] `rfc/short/rfcNNNN.md` - [why relevant]
  → Constraint: [specific RFC rule that applies here]

**Key insights:** (minimal context to resume after compaction)
- [insight from docs]

## Current Behavior (MANDATORY)

**Source files read:** (must read BEFORE you write this spec)
- [ ] `path/to/file.go` - [what it currently does]

**Behavior to preserve:** (unless the user explicitly said to change it)
- [output format, function signature, or `.ci` expectation callers depend on]

**Behavior to change:** (only what the user asked for)
- [list, or "None - preserve all existing behavior"]

## Data Flow (MANDATORY - see `ai/rules/architecture.md`)

### Entry Point
- [Where data enters: wire bytes, API command, config, plugin message]
- [Format at entry]

### Transformation Path
1. [Stage 1: for example "Wire parsing in internal/component/bgp/message/"]
2. [Stage 2: ...]

### Boundaries Crossed
| Boundary | How | Verified |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Engine ↔ Plugin | [JSON format, command syntax] | No |

### Integration Points
- [Existing function/type this connects to] - [how it integrates]

### Architectural Verification
| Check | Holds? | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| No bypassed layers (data flows through the intended path) | No | |
| No unintended coupling (components stay isolated) | No | |
| No duplicated functionality (extends existing, does not recreate) | No | |
| Zero-copy preserved where applicable (refs, not copies) | No | |
| Registration over hardcoding, outbound: new commands, views, families, and handlers register, and the core discovers them. No per-feature field, switch case, or factory is added to a core/shared package (`ai/rules/plugins.md`) | No | |
| Registration over hardcoding, inbound: no existing switch, seed map, validator, parser, runner, help string, or completion table has to learn this feature's name. Evidence names every list that was searched for the names this feature introduces, and the registry each one now derives from (`ai/rules/principles.md`) | No | |

## Risks & Assumptions

### Assumptions
| ID | Assumption | Basis (file/doc/user statement) | If wrong | Validated by | Status |
|----|-----------|--------------------------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| A-1 | [what this design assumes] | [where the assumption comes from] | [impact on design] | [test/grep/user confirmation] | unvalidated |

### Risks
| ID | Risk | Early signal | Mitigation / fallback |
|----|------|--------------|----------------------|
| R-1 | [what goes wrong] | [how we notice it] | [what we do about it] |

## Blast Radius

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What breaks if this is wrong? | [live sessions dropped / routes mis-encoded / config rejected / nothing user-visible] |
| How is it reverted? | [single commit revert / needs config migration / not revertible once peers see it] |
| Who else touches this path? | [other plugins, components, or specs working the same files] |

## Wiring Test (MANDATORY -- NOT deferrable)

| Entry Point | → | Feature Code | Test |
|-------------|---|--------------|------|
| [config/CLI/event that triggers it] | → | [function that actually runs] | [test name proving the chain] |

## Acceptance Criteria

| AC ID | Input / Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AC-1 | [what triggers the behavior] | [observable outcome] |

## End-to-End User Stories

| # | User does | Path through system | Test proving it works |
|---|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | [for example "receives SR-Policy UPDATE from peer"] | [wire -> mpnlri -> splitter -> Parse -> RIB] | [test name] |

## 🧪 TDD Test Plan

### Unit Tests
| Test | File | Validates | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| `TestXxx` | `internal/.../xxx_test.go` | [description] | |

- `test/.../*.ci` - [functional test for end-user behavior]

### Integration Checklist
| Integration Point | Applies? | File / reason |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| YANG schema (new RPCs/config) | | `internal/component/<name>/yang/` or the owning plugin's `yang/`. Read `ai/rules/config.md` (YANG vs env var) and `ai/rules/config.md` (naming) |
| YANG validation constraints | | Every leaf takes maximum native validation: `range`, `length`, `pattern`, `enumeration`, `type` from `ze-types.yang`. See `ai/patterns/config-option.md` |
| YANG custom validators | | Where native constraints are insufficient: `ze:validate` + `ValidateFn` + `CompleteFn` for completion |
| CLI commands/flags | | `cmd/ze/*/main.go` or subcommand files |
| CLI grammar (keyword before value) | | `ai/rules/cli.md` |
| Editor autocomplete | | Automatic for YANG enum/type leaves. Dynamic values need `CompleteFn` |
| Functional test for new RPC/API | | `test/plugin/*.ci` or `test/decode/*.ci` |
| Pipe completeness | | Route output through `ApplyPipes`/`ProcessPipes` per `ai/rules/cli.md` |
| Env var registration | | YANG leaves under `environment/` need a matching `ze.<name>.<leaf>` via `env.MustRegister()` |
| Doctor check for runtime dependencies | | Any new file path, socket, service, kernel module, listen port, procfs/sysctl, netlink, binary, or certificate: owning-package check + `internal/core/diagnostic/codes.go` + unit and functional test (`ai/rules/repo-maintenance.md`) |
| Prometheus counters/metrics | | Observable state: define, register, and list the metric names and labels here |
| BGP family surface (new SAFI / capability / attribute) | | The 12-section checklist in `ai/patterns/bgp-family.md` -- read it and record the answers there, not inline |

### Documentation Update Checklist (BLOCKING)
| # | Question | Applies? | File to update |
|---|----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | New user-facing feature? | | `docs/features.md` |
| 2 | Config syntax changed? | | `docs/guide/configuration.md`, `docs/architecture/config/syntax.md` |
| 3 | CLI command added/changed? | | `docs/guide/command-reference.md` |
| 4 | API/RPC added/changed? | | `docs/architecture/api/commands.md` |
| 5 | Plugin added/changed? | | `docs/guide/plugins.md` |
| 6 | Has a user guide page? | | `docs/guide/<topic>.md` |
| 7 | Wire format changed? | | `docs/architecture/wire/*.md` |
| 8 | Plugin SDK/protocol changed? | | `ai/rules/plugins.md`, `docs/architecture/api/process-protocol.md` |
| 9 | RFC behavior implemented, changed, or newly proven? | | `rfc/short/rfcNNNN.md` and the `docs/features/rfc-status.md` row, with source anchors |
| 10 | Test infrastructure changed? | | `docs/functional-tests.md` |
| 11 | Affects daemon comparison? | | `docs/comparison.md` |
| 12 | Internal architecture changed? | | `docs/architecture/core-design.md` or subsystem doc |
| 13 | Route metadata keys added/changed? | | `docs/architecture/meta/README.md`, `docs/architecture/meta/<plugin>.md` |
| 14 | Prometheus counters added/changed? | | `docs/plugin-development/metrics.md` or subsystem telemetry doc |
| 15 | Registered plugin, event type, send type, command, capability, or inventory changed? | | `docs/plugin-overview.md`, `docs/features/plugins.md`, `docs/guide/status.md` |
| 16 | Any changed source file referenced by existing doc source anchors? | | DERIVED, do not answer from memory: `./le spec citation anchors spec plan/<this-spec>.md` lists them. A doc DECLARED by a changed file's `// Design:` header BLOCKS until named here; a doc that only `<!-- source: -->` mentions it is advisory. Naming it as unaffected, with the reason, satisfies the check |
| 17 | Existing docs show config/CLI/API examples for this area? | | Verify examples against YANG/parser/handler and update stale syntax |

## Implementation Steps

1. **Phase: Wiring (MANDATORY FIRST)** -- register entry points, write failing wiring tests
   - Tests: [wiring test names from the Wiring Test table]
   - Files: [register.go, handler skeleton, route registration]
   - Verify: the entry point exists and is reachable. The wiring test fails because the feature is a stub
2. **Phase: [name]** -- [what to implement]
   - Tests: [test names from the TDD Plan]
   - Files: [files from Files to Modify]
   - Verify: tests fail → implement → tests pass → wiring test progresses

### Critical Review Checklist

| Check | What to verify for this spec |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Completeness | Every AC-N has an implementation at file:line |
| Feature completeness | Every user story has a working path, no broken links |
| Correctness | [feature-specific, for example "merge order correct", "error messages name the offending value"] |
| Naming | [feature-specific, for example "JSON keys kebab-case", "YANG leaf matches env var leaf"] |
| Data flow | [feature-specific, for example "resolution in X only, reactor unaware of Y"] |
| Rule: [relevant rule] | [what to check] |

### Deliverables Checklist

| Deliverable | Verification method |
|-------------|---------------------|
| [concrete thing that must exist] | [grep/ls/test command] |

### Security Review Checklist

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Input validation | [what inputs need validation and how] |

### Failure Routing

| Failure | Route To |
|---------|----------|
| Compilation error | Fix in the phase that introduced it |
| Test fails for the wrong reason | Fix the test assertion or setup |
| Test fails on behavior mismatch | Re-read the source in Current Behavior. If misunderstood → RESEARCH |
| Lint failure | Fix inline. If architectural → DESIGN |
| Functional test fails | Check the AC: wrong AC → DESIGN, correct AC → IMPLEMENT |
| Audit finds a missing AC | Back to the relevant phase and implement |
| 3 fix attempts failed | STOP. Report all 3 approaches. Ask the user |

## Design Insights

## Key Design Decisions
| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|

## Known Limitations
- [What was deliberately not done and why]

## RFC Documentation (Scope: protocol)

Add `// RFC NNNN Section X.Y: "<quoted requirement>"` above enforcing code.
MUST document: validation rules, error conditions, state transitions, timer
constraints, message ordering, and every MUST/MUST NOT.

## Checklist

### Pre-Spec Verification (before the design is presented)
- [ ] Metadata table present, with a valid Status, Depends, Phase and Updated
- [ ] `ai/INDEX.md` keyword table checked
- [ ] An `rfc/short/` summary exists for every RFC referenced
- [ ] Template format followed: the 🧪 emoji, tables rather than prose, `[ ]` never `[x]`
- [ ] No code snippets
- [ ] Files to Modify names feature code, not only tests
- [ ] Current Behavior and Data Flow sections completed
- [ ] AC-N rows carry testable assertions
- [ ] Every assumption has a Basis and a validation method; every failure mode is a risk row
- [ ] Required Reading carries `→ Decision:` / `→ Constraint:` checkpoints
- [ ] Integration Checklist marks "CLI grammar" when a command is added, "Doctor check" when a runtime dependency is

### Goal Gates (MUST pass)
- [ ] AC-1..AC-N all demonstrated
- [ ] Every user story has a working path and a passing test
- [ ] Wiring Test table complete: every row a concrete test name, none deferred
- [ ] `./le verify worktree` passes. It runs every stage against a COMMIT in a throwaway worktree, which is the pre-commit gate (`ai/rules/git-safety.md`). An in-place `./le verify current` is void the moment the tree moves under it
- [ ] Feature code integrated (`internal/*`, `cmd/*`), not library-only
- [ ] Integration and Documentation checklists answered Yes/No/N-A with evidence
- [ ] Architectural Verification table filled, including registration over hardcoding
- [ ] Critical Review passes (all 6 checks in `ai/rules/quality.md`)
- [ ] Every A-N confirmed or broken, none `unvalidated`
- [ ] Every item this spec did not do is a spec of its own, named here, in its own bucket

### TDD
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] Tests FAIL (paste output)
- [ ] Tests PASS (paste output)
- [ ] Boundary tests for all numeric inputs
- [ ] Functional `.ci` tests for end-to-end behavior
- [ ] Interop tests for protocol features (or N-A with a reason)

### Closure
- [ ] Append `plan/TEMPLATE-CLOSURE.md` and complete every section in it
- [ ] `/ze-review` gate clean, recorded via `internal/le/spec/session/review.go`
- [ ] Learned summary written to `plan/learned/NNN-<name>.md`
- [ ] **Commit A:** code + tests + docs + spec + learned summary
- [ ] **Commit B:** `git rm plan/<spec>` only (commit A preserves the spec in history)
