Recovery after compaction: `.claude/rules/post-compaction.md`.

## Task

**What the operator is promised.** Two leaves in
`internal/component/ike/ipsec/yang/ze-ipsec-conf.yang` promise a choice of
recovery behavior on an `ike-group`. `leaf close-action` is an enumeration of
`none`, `start` and `restart`, defaulting to `none`, described as "Action when
peer closes the IKE SA." `leaf action` inside `container dead-peer-detection` is
an enumeration of `restart`, `hold` and `clear`, defaulting to `hold`, described
as "Action when DPD detects a dead peer." A reader takes each enumeration value
to select a distinct behavior, because that is what an enumeration named "action"
says.

**What Ze does instead.** Every value of both leaves produces one behavior.
`parseIKEGroup` (`internal/component/ike/ipsec/config.go`) stores the close
action in `IKEGroup.CloseAction`, and no code outside the `ipsec` package reads
that field. `parseDPD` in the same file stores the DPD action in
`DPDConfig.Action`, `newDPDState` (`internal/component/ike/engine/dpd.go`) copies
it into `dpdState.action`, and its only reader is one log line in `maintainSA`
(`internal/component/ike/engine/established.go`), which prints the value when it
declares the peer dead. What follows that log line is the same for all three
values: `maintainSA` calls `ps.cleanupChild` and returns `errTimeout`. A peer
that deletes the IKE SA takes the neighboring branch, which returns
`errSADeletedByPeer`, again for all three close-action values. Both errors land
in the same place. `(*PeerSession).run`
(`internal/component/ike/engine/reconcile.go`) increments `ps.connectFailures`,
computes `reconnectDelay(ps)`, waits, and starts the next cycle. So Ze deletes
the Child SA, ends the session, and reconnects on an exponential backoff, whether
the operator wrote `none`, `start`, `restart`, `hold` or `clear`. The value that
behavior matches is `restart`, in both enumerations, and neither leaf defaults to
it. An operator who accepts the defaults is told `none` and `hold` and gets
`restart` twice.

**What closing it means.** Two leaves, one work item, because one change closes
both: the engine gains a branch on the configured action at the two exits
`maintainSA` already has, and both leaves are read at the same point in the same
package. Splitting them into two specs would put two branches in one function
from two pieces of work. The choice is the usual one, build the behaviors or
refuse the values, and here the refusal has a shape the other gaps do not.
Refusing the values Ze does not implement means refusing both defaults, since
`none` and `hold` are the defaults and neither describes what Ze does. A default
an operator never typed cannot be refused at commit without failing every
existing config, so the refusal route also requires changing both defaults to
`restart` first. That makes building the behaviors the smaller change of the two
in the parts that matter, and it is the honest one, because the enumerations were
published as a choice. The design decides what `none`, `start`, `clear` and
`hold` each mean for Ze, and it states each meaning as an observable difference
rather than a name, so an acceptance test can tell them apart
(`ai/rules/interop-and-goal-validation.md`).

## Required Reading

<!-- NEVER tick [ ] to [x] -- these checkboxes are template markers, not progress.
     Capture what you learned as -> Decision: / -> Constraint: annotations, which
     survive compaction; track reading progress in the session state file. -->

### Architecture Docs
- [ ] `docs/architecture/<doc>.md` - [why relevant]
  → Decision: [specific architectural decision that constrains this spec]
  → Constraint: [specific rule from the doc that applies here]

### RFC Summaries (Scope: protocol)
- [ ] `rfc/short/rfcNNNN.md` - [why relevant]
  → Constraint: [specific RFC rule that applies here]

**Key insights:** (minimal context to resume after compaction)
- [insight from docs]

## Current Behavior (MANDATORY)

**Source files read:** (must read BEFORE you write this spec)
- [ ] `path/to/file.go` - [what it currently does]

**Behavior to preserve:** (unless the user explicitly said to change it)
- [output format, function signature, or `.ci` expectation callers depend on]

**Behavior to change:** (only what the user asked for)
- [list, or "None - preserve all existing behavior"]

## Data Flow (MANDATORY - see `ai/rules/architecture.md`)

### Entry Point
- [Where data enters: wire bytes, API command, config, plugin message]
- [Format at entry]

### Transformation Path
1. [Stage 1: for example "Wire parsing in internal/component/bgp/message/"]
2. [Stage 2: ...]

### Boundaries Crossed
| Boundary | How | Verified |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Engine ↔ Plugin | [JSON format, command syntax] | No |

### Integration Points
- [Existing function/type this connects to] - [how it integrates]

### Architectural Verification
| Check | Holds? | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| No bypassed layers (data flows through the intended path) | No | |
| No unintended coupling (components stay isolated) | No | |
| No duplicated functionality (extends existing, does not recreate) | No | |
| Zero-copy preserved where applicable (refs, not copies) | No | |
| Registration over hardcoding: new commands, views, families, and handlers register, and the core discovers them. No per-feature field, switch case, or factory is added to a core/shared package (`ai/rules/plugins.md`) | No | |

## Risks & Assumptions

<!-- LIVE: written during RESEARCH/DESIGN, statuses updated during implementation.
     Gate answers from /ze-spec (assumption challenge, Failure Mode Analysis)
     land HERE, not only in conversation. -->

### Assumptions
<!-- Every row needs a validation method. `unvalidated` is not a valid final
     status: closure re-checks each one. A broken assumption also gets a
     Mistake Log row and a Deviations entry. -->
| ID | Assumption | Basis (file/doc/user statement) | If wrong | Validated by | Status |
|----|-----------|--------------------------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| A-1 | [what this design assumes] | [where the assumption comes from] | [impact on design] | [test/grep/user confirmation] | unvalidated |

### Risks
| ID | Risk | Early signal | Mitigation / fallback |
|----|------|--------------|----------------------|
| R-1 | [what goes wrong] | [how we notice it] | [what we do about it] |

## Blast Radius

<!-- What a wrong landing costs, and how to get out. A reviewer reads this first. -->
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What breaks if this is wrong? | [live sessions dropped / routes mis-encoded / config rejected / nothing user-visible] |
| How is it reverted? | [single commit revert / needs config migration / not revertible once peers see it] |
| Who else touches this path? | [other plugins, components, or specs working the same files] |

## Wiring Test (MANDATORY -- NOT deferrable)

<!-- BLOCKING: proves the feature is reachable from its intended entry point.
     Without it the feature exists in isolation: unit tests pass, nothing calls it.
     Every row needs a concrete test name. "Deferred"/"TODO"/empty is rejected
     by `internal/le/hookruntime/lifecycle.go`, which is the point: an unedited row fails. -->
| Entry Point | → | Feature Code | Test |
|-------------|---|--------------|------|
| [config/CLI/event that triggers it] | → | [function that actually runs] | [test name proving the chain] |

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Define BEFORE implementation. Each row is a testable assertion, stated as
     observable behavior, never as the mechanism used to reach it. -->
| AC ID | Input / Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AC-1 | [what triggers the behavior] | [observable outcome] |

## End-to-End User Stories

<!-- One row per user-facing operation the feature enables. ACs verify that
     components work; stories verify the chain is connected. A broken link in a
     path is a spec gap: add the missing component to ACs, Files, and Test Plan
     before proceeding. Delete this section when Scope is tooling or docs. -->
| # | User does | Path through system | Test proving it works |
|---|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | [for example "receives SR-Policy UPDATE from peer"] | [wire -> mpnlri -> splitter -> Parse -> RIB] | [test name] |

## 🧪 TDD Test Plan

### Unit Tests
| Test | File | Validates | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| `TestXxx` | `internal/.../xxx_test.go` | [description] | |

### Boundary Tests (numeric inputs)
| Field | Range | Last Valid | Invalid Below | Invalid Above |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| [field] | [min-max] | [value] | [value or N/A] | [value or N/A] |

### Functional Tests
<!-- REQUIRED: a unit test proves the algorithm, a .ci proves the user can reach
     the feature. New RPCs/APIs are never covered by unit tests alone.
     Structure: ai/patterns/functional-test.md -->
| Test | Location | End-User Scenario | Status |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `test-xxx` | `test/.../*.ci` | [what the user expects to happen] | |

### Interop Tests (Scope: protocol)
<!-- REQUIRED when wire-visible behavior changes. See
     ai/rules/interop-and-goal-validation.md, including the vacuity traps: prove
     the test FAILS when the behavior under test is reverted. -->
| Scenario | Directory | Peer Daemon | What It Proves | Status |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| `NN-feature-peer` | `test/interop/scenarios/` | [FRR/BIRD/GoBGP/strongSwan] | [protocol behavior validated] | |

## Files to Modify
<!-- MUST include feature code (internal/*, cmd/*), not only test files.
     Check each file's // Design: annotation: if the change alters behavior the
     referenced architecture doc describes, list that doc here too. -->
- `internal/...` - [feature changes]

## Files to Create
- `internal/...` - [new feature file]
- `test/.../*.ci` - [functional test for end-user behavior]

### Integration Checklist
<!-- Answer every row Yes / No / N-A. Never leave a bare marker: an unanswered
     row is indistinguishable from a forgotten one. N-A needs a reason. -->
| Integration Point | Applies? | File / reason |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| YANG schema (new RPCs/config) | | `internal/component/<name>/yang/` or the owning plugin's `yang/`. Read `ai/rules/config.md` (YANG vs env var) and `ai/rules/config.md` (naming) |
| YANG validation constraints | | Every leaf takes maximum native validation: `range`, `length`, `pattern`, `enumeration`, `type` from `ze-types.yang`. See `ai/patterns/config-option.md` |
| YANG custom validators | | Where native constraints are insufficient: `ze:validate` + `ValidateFn` + `CompleteFn` for completion |
| CLI commands/flags | | `cmd/ze/*/main.go` or subcommand files |
| CLI grammar (keyword before value) | | `ai/rules/cli.md` |
| Editor autocomplete | | Automatic for YANG enum/type leaves. Dynamic values need `CompleteFn` |
| Functional test for new RPC/API | | `test/plugin/*.ci` or `test/decode/*.ci` |
| Pipe completeness | | Route output through `ApplyPipes`/`ProcessPipes` per `ai/rules/cli.md` |
| Env var registration | | YANG leaves under `environment/` need a matching `ze.<name>.<leaf>` via `env.MustRegister()` |
| Doctor check for runtime dependencies | | Any new file path, socket, service, kernel module, listen port, procfs/sysctl, netlink, binary, or certificate: owning-package check + `internal/core/diagnostic/codes.go` + unit and functional test (`ai/rules/repo-maintenance.md`) |
| Prometheus counters/metrics | | Observable state: define, register, and list the metric names and labels here |
| BGP family surface (new SAFI / capability / attribute) | | The 12-section checklist in `ai/patterns/bgp-family.md` -- read it and record the answers there, not inline |

### Documentation Update Checklist (BLOCKING)
<!-- Answer every row Yes / No / N-A. A No must be backed by a source-aware
     check, not a guess: at minimum grep docs/ for source anchors pointing at the
     files you changed. Any factual doc change carries a source anchor. -->
| # | Question | Applies? | File to update |
|---|----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | New user-facing feature? | | `docs/features.md` |
| 2 | Config syntax changed? | | `docs/guide/configuration.md`, `docs/architecture/config/syntax.md` |
| 3 | CLI command added/changed? | | `docs/guide/command-reference.md` |
| 4 | API/RPC added/changed? | | `docs/architecture/api/commands.md` |
| 5 | Plugin added/changed? | | `docs/guide/plugins.md` |
| 6 | Has a user guide page? | | `docs/guide/<topic>.md` |
| 7 | Wire format changed? | | `docs/architecture/wire/*.md` |
| 8 | Plugin SDK/protocol changed? | | `ai/rules/plugins.md`, `docs/architecture/api/process-protocol.md` |
| 9 | RFC behavior implemented, changed, or newly proven? | | `rfc/short/rfcNNNN.md` and the `docs/features/rfc-status.md` row, with source anchors |
| 10 | Test infrastructure changed? | | `docs/functional-tests.md` |
| 11 | Affects daemon comparison? | | `docs/comparison.md` |
| 12 | Internal architecture changed? | | `docs/architecture/core-design.md` or subsystem doc |
| 13 | Route metadata keys added/changed? | | `docs/architecture/meta/README.md`, `docs/architecture/meta/<plugin>.md` |
| 14 | Prometheus counters added/changed? | | `docs/plugin-development/metrics.md` or subsystem telemetry doc |
| 15 | Registered plugin, event type, send type, command, capability, or inventory changed? | | `docs/plugin-overview.md`, `docs/features/plugins.md`, `docs/guide/status.md` |
| 16 | Any changed source file referenced by existing doc source anchors? | | DERIVED, do not answer from memory: `./le spec citation anchors spec plan/<this-spec>.md` lists them. A doc DECLARED by a changed file's `// Design:` header BLOCKS until named here; a doc that only `<!-- source: -->` mentions it is advisory. Naming it as unaffected, with the reason, satisfies the check |
| 17 | Existing docs show config/CLI/API examples for this area? | | Verify examples against YANG/parser/handler and update stale syntax |

## Implementation Steps

<!-- Concrete phases of work, not a restatement of the /ze-implement stages
     (those live in the skill). Phase 1 is ALWAYS wiring. Order by dependency:
     schema before resolution, resolution before CLI. Each phase follows TDD
     (write test -> fail -> implement -> pass) and ends with a self-critical
     review; fix what it finds before starting the next phase. -->

1. **Phase: Wiring (MANDATORY FIRST)** -- register entry points, write failing wiring tests
   - Tests: [wiring test names from the Wiring Test table]
   - Files: [register.go, handler skeleton, route registration]
   - Verify: the entry point exists and is reachable. The wiring test fails because the feature is a stub
2. **Phase: [name]** -- [what to implement]
   - Tests: [test names from the TDD Plan]
   - Files: [files from Files to Modify]
   - Verify: tests fail → implement → tests pass → wiring test progresses

### Critical Review Checklist

<!-- Feature-SPECIFIC checks. The generic ones in ai/rules/quality.md always
     apply and are not repeated here. A row that would read the same on any spec
     is not worth a row. -->
| Check | What to verify for this spec |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Completeness | Every AC-N has an implementation at file:line |
| Feature completeness | Every user story has a working path, no broken links |
| Correctness | [feature-specific, for example "merge order correct", "error messages name the offending value"] |
| Naming | [feature-specific, for example "JSON keys kebab-case", "YANG leaf matches env var leaf"] |
| Data flow | [feature-specific, for example "resolution in X only, reactor unaware of Y"] |
| Rule: [relevant rule] | [what to check] |

### Deliverables Checklist

<!-- Every deliverable with a command that proves it. "Looks done" is not a
     verification method. -->
| Deliverable | Verification method |
|-------------|---------------------|
| [concrete thing that must exist] | [grep/ls/test command] |

### Security Review Checklist

<!-- Feature-specific: untrusted input, injection, resource exhaustion, error
     leakage, authorization that could fail open. -->
| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Input validation | [what inputs need validation and how] |

### Failure Routing

| Failure | Route To |
|---------|----------|
| Compilation error | Fix in the phase that introduced it |
| Test fails for the wrong reason | Fix the test assertion or setup |
| Test fails on behavior mismatch | Re-read the source in Current Behavior. If misunderstood → RESEARCH |
| Lint failure | Fix inline. If architectural → DESIGN |
| Functional test fails | Check the AC: wrong AC → DESIGN, correct AC → IMPLEMENT |
| Audit finds a missing AC | Back to the relevant phase and implement |
| 3 fix attempts failed | STOP. Report all 3 approaches. Ask the user |

## Design Insights
<!-- LIVE: write immediately when you learn something. At closure these route to
     a subsystem arch doc, a rule, or the learned summary. -->

## Key Design Decisions
<!-- "Chose X over Y because Z." The rejected alternative is the valuable half. -->
| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|

## Known Limitations
<!-- Deliberate scope boundaries. Anything here that is actually outstanding work
     is not a limitation: write it as its own spec, in the bucket that item
     belongs to, and name that spec here (ai/rules/planning.md). -->
- [What was deliberately not done and why]

## RFC Documentation (Scope: protocol)

Add `// RFC NNNN Section X.Y: "<quoted requirement>"` above enforcing code.
MUST document: validation rules, error conditions, state transitions, timer
constraints, message ordering, and every MUST/MUST NOT.

## Checklist

### Pre-Spec Verification (before the design is presented)
- [ ] Metadata table present, with a valid Status, Depends, Phase and Updated
- [ ] `ai/INDEX.md` keyword table checked
- [ ] An `rfc/short/` summary exists for every RFC referenced
- [ ] Template format followed: the 🧪 emoji, tables rather than prose, `[ ]` never `[x]`
- [ ] No code snippets
- [ ] Files to Modify names feature code, not only tests
- [ ] Current Behavior and Data Flow sections completed
- [ ] AC-N rows carry testable assertions
- [ ] Every assumption has a Basis and a validation method; every failure mode is a risk row
- [ ] Required Reading carries `→ Decision:` / `→ Constraint:` checkpoints
- [ ] Integration Checklist marks "CLI grammar" when a command is added, "Doctor check" when a runtime dependency is

### Goal Gates (MUST pass)
- [ ] AC-1..AC-N all demonstrated
- [ ] Every user story has a working path and a passing test
- [ ] Wiring Test table complete: every row a concrete test name, none deferred
- [ ] `./le verify worktree` passes. It runs every stage against a COMMIT in a throwaway worktree, which is the pre-commit gate (`ai/rules/git-safety.md`). An in-place `./le verify current` is void the moment the tree moves under it

- [ ] Integration and Documentation checklists answered Yes/No/N-A with evidence
- [ ] Architectural Verification table filled, including registration over hardcoding
- [ ] Critical Review passes (all 6 checks in `ai/rules/quality.md`)
- [ ] Every A-N confirmed or broken, none `unvalidated`
- [ ] Every item this spec did not do is a spec of its own, named here, in its own bucket

### TDD
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] Tests FAIL (paste output)
- [ ] Tests PASS (paste output)
- [ ] Boundary tests for all numeric inputs
- [ ] Functional `.ci` tests for end-to-end behavior
- [ ] Interop tests for protocol features (or N-A with a reason)

### Closure
- [ ] Append `plan/TEMPLATE-CLOSURE.md` and complete every section in it
- [ ] `/ze-review` gate clean, recorded via `internal/le/spec/session/review.go`
- [ ] Learned summary written to `plan/learned/NNN-<name>.md`
- [ ] **Commit A:** code + tests + docs + spec + learned summary
- [ ] **Commit B:** `git rm plan/<spec>` only (commit A preserves the spec in history)
