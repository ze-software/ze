# Spec: the Review Gate loop has no termination bound, and cmd_check mechanically drives another pass after every fix

<!-- DESIGN-TIME template: everything that must exist BEFORE code is written.
     The closure half (Implementation Summary, Audit, Goal Validation, Review
     Gate, Pre-Commit Verification, Mistake Log) lives in
     plan/TEMPLATE-CLOSURE.md and is APPENDED by /ze-close at step 1.
     Do not copy it in advance: sections copied 300 lines ahead of their use
     reach closure untouched, the ones created when needed get filled. -->

<!-- Scope drives which optional blocks below apply. Say which one this is, so
     an absent section reads as "inapplicable" rather than "skipped".
     Deferral shard: every deferred item lands there (ai/rules/planning.md)
     and closure must resolve its rows, so name the file from the start. -->

## Task

**The problem.** The Review Gate loop (`ai/rules/planning.md`, "Critical Review Is the
Central Deliverable" and "Bounding the loop") has no state in which it is guaranteed to
stop. Its exit condition is "a round finds no BLOCKER and no ISSUE inside its OWN scope,
AND no always-in-scope finding anywhere". Two of its terms are unbounded, so a run that
never ends is permitted by the rule as written rather than prevented by it.

**Term one: the shrinking scope never reaches zero.** Round N+1's scope is round N's
fixes. Every fix is new code. The rule states the governing fact itself, but only about
round 1: "On a diff of any size, a full-diff pass always finds something." That sentence
is equally true of a one-line fix diff, and the rule does not notice. Scope shrinks in
size, never to nothing, so no fixed point is guaranteed.

**Term two: the eight always-in-scope classes are unscoped by construction.** They apply
"whatever round surfaces them and whoever caused them", their severity floor is ISSUE,
and "Where the round's scope and that list disagree, the list wins and the loop takes
another pass". They can therefore re-open the loop from outside the shrinking scope,
without limit.

**The symptom.** Termination rests on a reviewer grading findings NOTE, and the rule
forbids exactly that move: "tagging one down is the cheapest exit from a list whose
purpose is to have no exits". The rule closes the only door it exits through. "There is
no cap on the NUMBER of passes" is a deliberate choice in the same section, so this is
not a wording slip. A session that follows the rule literally cannot close its work.

**The loop's engine is mechanical, not only prose.** `cmd_check` (`scripts/dev/review_gate.py`)
holds no concept of a round: it checks the artifact's verdict, then its coverage of the
commit's code files, then whether any reviewed file's hash still matches. That third
branch is what turns the rule's advice into a machine: any fix changes a reviewed file,
the hash stops matching, and the gate BLOCKS with "Every fix is new code that needs a
fresh review. Re-review and re-record." So each fix mechanically forces another pass, and
nothing anywhere counts passes or can stop them. `cmd_record` writes the artifact and
counts nothing either.

**What a bound has to respect.** The two kinds of finding behave differently and the rule
treats them alike. The eight classes (unwired symbol, vacuous test, acceptance criterion
with no test, user-facing behavior with no functional test, Linux-only code with no QEMU
test, removed guard, newly added guard that fails open, RFC or interop non-conformance)
are CONVERGENT: each names a concrete checkable defect, fixing one keeps it fixed, and
the set shrinks monotonically. Open-ended quality findings (naming, structure, "this
could be simpler") are NON-CONVERGENT: they regenerate on every diff. Whether the bound
is a pass cap on the second kind with overflow routed to a spec, a strictly-shrinking
scope measure, a severity floor that rises per round, or something else, is the design
question. Weakening the first kind is not on the table: RFC and interop non-conformance
sit on rung 2 of `ai/rules/rule-precedence.md`, and no bound on a review loop can retire
an obligation owed outside this repository.

**Reproduction.** Read `ai/rules/planning.md`, "Bounding the loop", and look for a term
that decreases to a stopping value. Then read `cmd_check` (`scripts/dev/review_gate.py`)
and look for a round counter. Neither exists.

**Provenance.** Raised by Thomas on 2026-08-08 while the deferral-shard gate spec
(`spec-fixit-deferral-shard-gate-reads-only-head`, since closed) was in design: "this code can
not NOT forever run and find something as code can never be perfect and there will always
be something to complain about, ie: it will run forever". The rule text and `cmd_check`
were read to confirm the mechanism before this spec was written. No deferral row: a
source spec did not surface this, Thomas did, and `ai/rules/planning.md` exempts work
that was never in a spec's scope.

## Required Reading

<!-- NEVER tick [ ] to [x] -- these checkboxes are template markers, not progress.
     Capture what you learned as -> Decision: / -> Constraint: annotations, which
     survive compaction; track reading progress in the session state file. -->

### Architecture Docs
- [ ] `docs/architecture/<doc>.md` - [why relevant]
  → Decision: [specific architectural decision that constrains this spec]
  → Constraint: [specific rule from the doc that applies here]

### RFC Summaries (Scope: protocol)
- [ ] `rfc/short/rfcNNNN.md` - [why relevant]
  → Constraint: [specific RFC rule that applies here]

**Key insights:** (minimal context to resume after compaction)
- [insight from docs]

## Current Behavior (MANDATORY)

**Source files read:** (must read BEFORE you write this spec)
- [ ] `path/to/file.go` - [what it currently does]

**Behavior to preserve:** (unless the user explicitly said to change it)
- [output format, function signature, or `.ci` expectation callers depend on]

**Behavior to change:** (only what the user asked for)
- [list, or "None - preserve all existing behavior"]

## Data Flow (MANDATORY - see `ai/rules/architecture.md`)

### Entry Point
- [Where data enters: wire bytes, API command, config, plugin message]
- [Format at entry]

### Transformation Path
1. [Stage 1: for example "Wire parsing in internal/component/bgp/message/"]
2. [Stage 2: ...]

### Boundaries Crossed
| Boundary | How | Verified |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Engine ↔ Plugin | [JSON format, command syntax] | No |

### Integration Points
- [Existing function/type this connects to] - [how it integrates]

### Architectural Verification
| Check | Holds? | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| No bypassed layers (data flows through the intended path) | No | |
| No unintended coupling (components stay isolated) | No | |
| No duplicated functionality (extends existing, does not recreate) | No | |
| Zero-copy preserved where applicable (refs, not copies) | No | |
| Registration over hardcoding: new commands, views, families, and handlers register, and the core discovers them. No per-feature field, switch case, or factory is added to a core/shared package (`ai/rules/plugins.md`) | No | |

## Risks & Assumptions

<!-- LIVE: written during RESEARCH/DESIGN, statuses updated during implementation.
     Gate answers from /ze-spec (assumption challenge, Failure Mode Analysis)
     land HERE, not only in conversation. -->

### Assumptions
<!-- Every row needs a validation method. `unvalidated` is not a valid final
     status: closure re-checks each one. A broken assumption also gets a
     Mistake Log row and a Deviations entry. -->
| ID | Assumption | Basis (file/doc/user statement) | If wrong | Validated by | Status |
|----|-----------|--------------------------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| A-1 | [what this design assumes] | [where the assumption comes from] | [impact on design] | [test/grep/user confirmation] | unvalidated |

### Risks
| ID | Risk | Early signal | Mitigation / fallback |
|----|------|--------------|----------------------|
| R-1 | [what goes wrong] | [how we notice it] | [what we do about it] |

## Blast Radius

<!-- What a wrong landing costs, and how to get out. A reviewer reads this first. -->
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What breaks if this is wrong? | [live sessions dropped / routes mis-encoded / config rejected / nothing user-visible] |
| How is it reverted? | [single commit revert / needs config migration / not revertible once peers see it] |
| Who else touches this path? | [other plugins, components, or specs working the same files] |

## Wiring Test (MANDATORY -- NOT deferrable)

<!-- BLOCKING: proves the feature is reachable from its intended entry point.
     Without it the feature exists in isolation: unit tests pass, nothing calls it.
     Every row needs a concrete test name. "Deferred"/"TODO"/empty is rejected
     by .claude/hooks/validate-spec.sh, which is the point: an unedited row fails. -->
| Entry Point | → | Feature Code | Test |
|-------------|---|--------------|------|
| [config/CLI/event that triggers it] | → | [function that actually runs] | [test name proving the chain] |

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Define BEFORE implementation. Each row is a testable assertion, stated as
     observable behavior, never as the mechanism used to reach it. -->
| AC ID | Input / Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AC-1 | [what triggers the behavior] | [observable outcome] |

## 🧪 TDD Test Plan

### Unit Tests
| Test | File | Validates | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| `TestXxx` | `internal/.../xxx_test.go` | [description] | |

### Boundary Tests (numeric inputs)
| Field | Range | Last Valid | Invalid Below | Invalid Above |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| [field] | [min-max] | [value] | [value or N/A] | [value or N/A] |

### Functional Tests
<!-- REQUIRED: a unit test proves the algorithm, a .ci proves the user can reach
     the feature. New RPCs/APIs are never covered by unit tests alone.
     Structure: ai/patterns/functional-test.md -->
| Test | Location | End-User Scenario | Status |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `test-xxx` | `test/.../*.ci` | [what the user expects to happen] | |

### Interop Tests (Scope: protocol)
<!-- REQUIRED when wire-visible behavior changes. See
     ai/rules/interop-and-goal-validation.md, including the vacuity traps: prove
     the test FAILS when the behavior under test is reverted. -->
| Scenario | Directory | Peer Daemon | What It Proves | Status |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| `NN-feature-peer` | `test/interop/scenarios/` | [FRR/BIRD/GoBGP/strongSwan] | [protocol behavior validated] | |

## Files to Modify
<!-- MUST include feature code (internal/*, cmd/*), not only test files.
     Check each file's // Design: annotation: if the change alters behavior the
     referenced architecture doc describes, list that doc here too. -->
- `internal/...` - [feature changes]

## Files to Create
- `internal/...` - [new feature file]
- `test/.../*.ci` - [functional test for end-user behavior]

### Integration Checklist
<!-- Answer every row Yes / No / N-A. Never leave a bare marker: an unanswered
     row is indistinguishable from a forgotten one. N-A needs a reason. -->
| Integration Point | Applies? | File / reason |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| YANG schema (new RPCs/config) | | `internal/component/<name>/yang/` or the owning plugin's `yang/`. Read `ai/rules/config.md` (YANG vs env var) and `ai/rules/config.md` (naming) |
| YANG validation constraints | | Every leaf takes maximum native validation: `range`, `length`, `pattern`, `enumeration`, `type` from `ze-types.yang`. See `ai/patterns/config-option.md` |
| YANG custom validators | | Where native constraints are insufficient: `ze:validate` + `ValidateFn` + `CompleteFn` for completion |
| CLI commands/flags | | `cmd/ze/*/main.go` or subcommand files |
| CLI grammar (keyword before value) | | `ai/rules/cli.md` |
| Editor autocomplete | | Automatic for YANG enum/type leaves. Dynamic values need `CompleteFn` |
| Functional test for new RPC/API | | `test/plugin/*.ci` or `test/decode/*.ci` |
| Pipe completeness | | Route output through `ApplyPipes`/`ProcessPipes` per `ai/rules/cli.md` |
| Env var registration | | YANG leaves under `environment/` need a matching `ze.<name>.<leaf>` via `env.MustRegister()` |
| Doctor check for runtime dependencies | | Any new file path, socket, service, kernel module, listen port, procfs/sysctl, netlink, binary, or certificate: owning-package check + `internal/core/diagnostic/codes.go` + unit and functional test (`ai/rules/repo-maintenance.md`) |
| Prometheus counters/metrics | | Observable state: define, register, and list the metric names and labels here |
| BGP family surface (new SAFI / capability / attribute) | | The 12-section checklist in `ai/patterns/bgp-family.md` -- read it and record the answers there, not inline |

### Documentation Update Checklist (BLOCKING)
<!-- Answer every row Yes / No / N-A. A No must be backed by a source-aware
     check, not a guess: at minimum grep docs/ for source anchors pointing at the
     files you changed. Any factual doc change carries a source anchor. -->
| # | Question | Applies? | File to update |
|---|----------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | New user-facing feature? | | `docs/features.md` |
| 2 | Config syntax changed? | | `docs/guide/configuration.md`, `docs/architecture/config/syntax.md` |
| 3 | CLI command added/changed? | | `docs/guide/command-reference.md` |
| 4 | API/RPC added/changed? | | `docs/architecture/api/commands.md` |
| 5 | Plugin added/changed? | | `docs/guide/plugins.md` |
| 6 | Has a user guide page? | | `docs/guide/<topic>.md` |
| 7 | Wire format changed? | | `docs/architecture/wire/*.md` |
| 8 | Plugin SDK/protocol changed? | | `ai/rules/plugins.md`, `docs/architecture/api/process-protocol.md` |
| 9 | RFC behavior implemented, changed, or newly proven? | | `rfc/short/rfcNNNN.md` and the `docs/features/rfc-status.md` row, with source anchors |
| 10 | Test infrastructure changed? | | `docs/functional-tests.md` |
| 11 | Affects daemon comparison? | | `docs/comparison.md` |
| 12 | Internal architecture changed? | | `docs/architecture/core-design.md` or subsystem doc |
| 13 | Route metadata keys added/changed? | | `docs/architecture/meta/README.md`, `docs/architecture/meta/<plugin>.md` |
| 14 | Prometheus counters added/changed? | | `docs/plugin-development/metrics.md` or subsystem telemetry doc |
| 15 | Registered plugin, event type, send type, command, capability, or inventory changed? | | `docs/plugin-overview.md`, `docs/features/plugins.md`, `docs/guide/status.md` |
| 16 | Any changed source file referenced by existing doc source anchors? | | Grep `docs/` for `source: <changed-file>` and update each stale claim |
| 17 | Existing docs show config/CLI/API examples for this area? | | Verify examples against YANG/parser/handler and update stale syntax |

## Implementation Steps

<!-- Concrete phases of work, not a restatement of the /ze-implement stages
     (those live in the skill). Phase 1 is ALWAYS wiring. Order by dependency:
     schema before resolution, resolution before CLI. Each phase follows TDD
     (write test -> fail -> implement -> pass) and ends with a self-critical
     review; fix what it finds before starting the next phase. -->

1. **Phase: Wiring (MANDATORY FIRST)** -- register entry points, write failing wiring tests
   - Tests: [wiring test names from the Wiring Test table]
   - Files: [register.go, handler skeleton, route registration]
   - Verify: the entry point exists and is reachable. The wiring test fails because the feature is a stub
2. **Phase: [name]** -- [what to implement]
   - Tests: [test names from the TDD Plan]
   - Files: [files from Files to Modify]
   - Verify: tests fail → implement → tests pass → wiring test progresses

### Critical Review Checklist

<!-- Feature-SPECIFIC checks. The generic ones in ai/rules/quality.md always
     apply and are not repeated here. A row that would read the same on any spec
     is not worth a row. -->
| Check | What to verify for this spec |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Completeness | Every AC-N has an implementation at file:line |
| Feature completeness | Every user story has a working path, no broken links |
| Correctness | [feature-specific, for example "merge order correct", "error messages name the offending value"] |
| Naming | [feature-specific, for example "JSON keys kebab-case", "YANG leaf matches env var leaf"] |
| Data flow | [feature-specific, for example "resolution in X only, reactor unaware of Y"] |
| Rule: [relevant rule] | [what to check] |

### Deliverables Checklist

<!-- Every deliverable with a command that proves it. "Looks done" is not a
     verification method. -->
| Deliverable | Verification method |
|-------------|---------------------|
| [concrete thing that must exist] | [grep/ls/test command] |

### Security Review Checklist

<!-- Feature-specific: untrusted input, injection, resource exhaustion, error
     leakage, authorization that could fail open. -->
| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Input validation | [what inputs need validation and how] |

### Failure Routing

| Failure | Route To |
|---------|----------|
| Compilation error | Fix in the phase that introduced it |
| Test fails for the wrong reason | Fix the test assertion or setup |
| Test fails on behavior mismatch | Re-read the source in Current Behavior. If misunderstood → RESEARCH |
| Lint failure | Fix inline. If architectural → DESIGN |
| Functional test fails | Check the AC: wrong AC → DESIGN, correct AC → IMPLEMENT |
| Audit finds a missing AC | Back to the relevant phase and implement |
| 3 fix attempts failed | STOP. Report all 3 approaches. Ask the user |

## Design Insights
<!-- LIVE: write immediately when you learn something. At closure these route to
     a subsystem arch doc, a rule, or the learned summary. -->

## Key Design Decisions
<!-- "Chose X over Y because Z." The rejected alternative is the valuable half. -->
| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|

## Known Limitations
<!-- Deliberate scope boundaries. Anything here that is actually outstanding work
     needs a row in the deferral shard named in the metadata table. -->
- [What was deliberately not done and why]

## RFC Documentation (Scope: protocol)

Add `// RFC NNNN Section X.Y: "<quoted requirement>"` above enforcing code.
MUST document: validation rules, error conditions, state transitions, timer
constraints, message ordering, and every MUST/MUST NOT.
