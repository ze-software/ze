// Design: docs/architecture/core-design.md -- le's composition, one import per tool
//
// One package, one register.go, one init(). Adding a tool to le is this file
// plus a blank import in internal/le/register.go, and nothing else.

	// registers the command. A claim whose command never registered is red, so
