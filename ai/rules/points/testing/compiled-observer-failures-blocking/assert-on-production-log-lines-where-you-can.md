**Equivalent positive assertions also work, and SHOULD be preferred.** The cmd-4 fix took the second
route: it asserted `expect=stderr:pattern=prefix-list accept` plus
`reject=stderr:pattern=prefix-list reject` on production log lines emitted by
`bgp-filter-prefix`. That is the strongest pattern because it verifies the
production code path, not the observer.
