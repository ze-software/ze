| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Port reuse race in reactor tests | `Stop()` not waiting for cleanup | Ensure cleanup goroutines complete before returning |
| Completion test fails intermittently | Real bug, not flaky | Check `completeShowPath` includes YANG schema children |
| Inter-message timing in plugin tests | Sleep too tight under load | Increase inter-message delay or use synchronization |
