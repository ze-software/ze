Use string-typed identifiers even when the conventional representation is numeric.
Cache IDs, VLAN IDs, session IDs: accept and store as strings. Parse to numeric
only at the point of use if the underlying API requires it. This avoids:
- Grammar ambiguity between numeric keywords and numeric IDs
- Unnecessary coupling to a representation (IDs may become non-numeric later)
- Parsing errors surfacing at the wrong layer
