| Signal | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| A `{not-applicable}` whose reason is "ze has no X producer at all" | That admission is often the violation of a separate MUST requiring X to exist. RFC 4271 §5.1.4's "MUST implement a mechanism ... that allows MULTI_EXIT_DISC to be removed" was unextracted, and two requirements cited its absence as their exemption. |
| A section whose siblings are enumerated but one clause is not | RFC 8666 §5's "MUST be ignored on reception" was omitted while §6, §7.1 and §7.2 each had it. An enumeration hole, not a style choice. |
